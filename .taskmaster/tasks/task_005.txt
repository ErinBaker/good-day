# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Memory Creation Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the user interface for adding new memory entries with photos, details, and person tagging
# Details:
Implement a memory creation form with the following components:

1. Form layout with Material-UI components
2. Title input field with validation
3. Date picker with default to current date
4. Rich text description field with character count
5. Photo upload component with preview
6. Person tagging interface with search and selection
7. Submit button with loading state

Implement form validation for required fields. Connect form submission to the GraphQL mutation for creating memories. Handle success and error states with appropriate user feedback. Implement auto-save functionality to prevent data loss.

# Test Strategy:
Test form validation with various inputs. Verify that photos can be uploaded and previewed. Test person tagging functionality. Verify that form submission creates a new memory with all provided information. Test auto-save functionality by simulating browser crashes.
