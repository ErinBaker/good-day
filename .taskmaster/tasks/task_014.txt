# Task ID: 14
# Title: Optimize Performance and Responsiveness
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve application performance for large memory collections and different devices
# Details:
Implement performance optimizations including:

1. Image lazy loading and progressive enhancement
2. Virtualized lists for large memory collections
3. GraphQL query optimization and caching
4. Code splitting for faster initial load
5. Responsive design adjustments for mobile devices
6. Touch interaction optimization for mobile users

Use React performance tools to identify and fix bottlenecks. Implement proper caching strategies for GraphQL queries. Optimize image delivery for different screen sizes and network conditions.

# Test Strategy:
Measure performance metrics before and after optimizations. Test with large memory collections to verify scalability. Test on various devices to ensure responsive design works correctly. Verify that mobile interactions are smooth and intuitive.
