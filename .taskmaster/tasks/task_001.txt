# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with React frontend, Node.js backend, and GraphQL API architecture
# Details:
Create a new project repository with the following structure:
- Frontend: React application with Material-UI
- Backend: Node.js server with Express
- API: GraphQL server with Apollo

Setup necessary configuration files including package.json, .gitignore, and environment configuration. Configure build tools like Webpack or Create React App for the frontend. Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Initialize the development environment with proper folder structure for components, services, and utilities.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the development environment can be set up with a single command. Ensure that the frontend can communicate with the backend through GraphQL queries. Test that the basic application runs without errors in development mode.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Project Repository and Base Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the project repository and set up the basic folder structure for frontend and backend components.
### Details:
Create a new Git repository. Initialize the project with npm init to create the root package.json. Set up a monorepo structure with 'frontend' and 'backend' directories. Create .gitignore file with appropriate entries for node_modules, build directories, and environment files. Add README.md with project overview and setup instructions.

## 2. Configure Frontend React Application [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up the React frontend with Material-UI and necessary build configurations.
### Details:
Inside the frontend directory, initialize a new React application using Create React App (CRA). Install Material-UI dependencies (npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled). Set up basic folder structure for components, pages, services, and utilities. Configure basic routing with react-router-dom. Create a simple App component and index entry point. Add frontend-specific package.json scripts for development, building, and testing.

## 3. Set Up Node.js Backend with Express [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create the Node.js backend server with Express framework and necessary middleware.
### Details:
Inside the backend directory, initialize a new Node.js application with npm init. Install Express and other necessary dependencies (cors, body-parser, dotenv, etc.). Create server.js as the entry point. Set up middleware for request parsing, CORS, and error handling. Implement a basic health check endpoint. Configure environment variables with dotenv. Create folder structure for routes, controllers, models, and utilities. Add backend-specific package.json scripts for development and production.

## 4. Implement GraphQL API with Apollo Server [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Set up Apollo Server for GraphQL API and integrate it with the Express backend.
### Details:
Install Apollo Server and GraphQL dependencies (apollo-server-express, graphql). Create a basic GraphQL schema with type definitions and resolvers. Set up Apollo Server and integrate it with the Express application. Create folders for schema definitions, resolvers, and data sources. Implement a simple query to test the GraphQL endpoint. Configure GraphQL playground for development. Add proper error handling for GraphQL operations.

## 5. Configure Development Tools and Connect Frontend to API [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.4
### Description: Set up code quality tools and connect the React frontend to the GraphQL API.
### Details:
Install and configure ESLint and Prettier for both frontend and backend. Create configuration files (.eslintrc, .prettierrc) with appropriate rules. Set up Apollo Client in the React frontend to connect to the GraphQL API. Create a simple component that fetches data from the API to verify the connection. Configure proxy settings in the frontend to communicate with the backend during development. Set up scripts in the root package.json to run both frontend and backend concurrently. Create documentation for the development workflow.
