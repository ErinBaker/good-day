# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Photo Upload System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a system for uploading, validating, and storing photos for memory entries
# Details:
Implement a photo upload system with the following features:

1. File upload component in React using drag-and-drop and file picker
2. Backend route for handling file uploads
3. File validation for accepted formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
4. File size limitations with appropriate error handling
5. Image processing for optimization and thumbnail generation
6. Secure storage of images with proper file naming and organization
7. Image retrieval API for displaying photos in memory entries

Use a library like multer for handling multipart form data. Implement image processing with sharp or another image manipulation library. Store images in a file system with proper backup considerations.

# Test Strategy:
Test uploading various file formats to verify validation. Test uploading files of different sizes to verify size limitations. Verify that images are properly optimized and thumbnails are generated. Test image retrieval to ensure photos can be displayed correctly.
