# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Memory Editing and Deletion
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality for editing and deleting existing memory entries
# Details:
Develop memory editing and deletion features with the following components:

1. Edit form based on memory creation form
2. Pre-populated fields with existing memory data
3. Photo replacement or removal options
4. Person tag management for adding/removing people
5. Delete confirmation with clear warnings
6. Update tracking with modified timestamps

Connect edit functionality to GraphQL mutation for updating memories. Implement delete functionality with proper confirmation and data cleanup. Handle edge cases like partial updates and concurrent edits.

# Test Strategy:
Test editing various aspects of a memory. Verify that photos can be replaced or removed. Test adding and removing person tags. Verify that deletion works correctly with proper confirmation. Test edge cases like canceling edits and handling validation errors.
