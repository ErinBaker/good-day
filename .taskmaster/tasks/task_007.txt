# Description: Create a chronological timeline view for browsing memory entries
# Details:
Implement a memory timeline with the following features:

1. Chronological display of memory cards
2. Infinite scrolling or pagination for large collections
3. Memory cards showing photo, title, date, and tagged people
4. Date-based navigation and filtering
5. Loading states and empty states

Connect timeline to GraphQL query for retrieving memories with sorting and pagination. Implement lazy loading for images to improve performance. Create smooth scrolling experience with proper loading indicators.

Test timeline with various numbers of memories. Verify that chronological ordering is correct. Test pagination or infinite scrolling with large collections. Verify that memory cards display all relevant information correctly.
