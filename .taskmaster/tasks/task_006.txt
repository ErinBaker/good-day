# Priority: high
# Description: Create interfaces for adding, editing, and managing people profiles
# Details:
Develop person management functionality with the following features:

1. Person creation form with name and optional relationship fields
2. Person list view with search and filtering
3. Person edit interface for updating information
4. Person deletion with confirmation and impact assessment
5. Duplicate detection to prevent creating the same person multiple times

Connect person management to GraphQL mutations for creating, updating, and deleting people. Implement validation for required fields and duplicate detection. Create a reusable person selection component for memory tagging.

# Test Strategy:
Test person creation with various inputs. Verify that duplicate detection works correctly. Test editing and deleting people. Verify that person selection component works correctly in memory creation and editing contexts.
