Narrative
Sarah sits at her kitchen table on a quiet Sunday evening, scrolling through hundreds of photos scattered across her phone, laptop, and various cloud storage accounts. She pauses at a picture from her daughter's college graduation three months ago, trying to remember who the family friend standing next to them was and what they had talked about that day. The photo captures a moment of joy, but the context—the conversations, the emotions, the significance—has already begun to fade.

Frustrated by this recurring experience of losing the stories behind her photos, Sarah discovers Good Times and decides to give it a try. She begins by adding the important people in her life: her daughter Emma, her husband Mark, her sister Lisa, and close family friends. Then, she uploads that graduation photo and takes time to write about the day—how proud she felt, the conversation with Emma's favorite professor, the celebration dinner where they laughed until their sides hurt.

Over the following weeks, Sarah finds herself looking forward to her evening ritual of adding memories to Good Times. She creates entries for family dinners, weekend hikes, and quiet moments that might otherwise be forgotten. When she tags her sister Lisa in a memory from their childhood home visit, she discovers a timeline of their relationship that brings tears to her eyes—decades of shared experiences, from childhood adventures to supporting each other through life's challenges.

Six months later, Sarah's daughter Emma visits for the holidays. Together, they browse through Sarah's memory collection, reliving family stories and discovering connections they had never noticed before. Emma asks for access to create her own Good Times collection, inspired by her mother's thoughtful approach to preserving their family's story. What started as a solution to scattered photos has become a meaningful practice that strengthens family bonds and ensures that life's most precious moments are never truly lost.
