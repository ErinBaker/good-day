## Task 1: Setup Project Infrastructure

### Summary of What Was Implemented

- **Project Initialization:**  
  The project was initialized as a monorepo with a unified `src` directory containing both frontend and backend logic.
- **Frontend:**  
  - Built with React (v19) and Material-UI (MUI v7), using Next.js (v15) as the application framework.
  - The frontend structure includes `src/app` for pages, components, and services.
- **Backend:**  
  - Node.js backend is integrated within the Next.js app, using API routes and a GraphQL server.
  - GraphQL API is implemented with Apollo Server, with schema and resolvers in `src/graphql/`.
- **Configuration:**  
  - `package.json` at the root manages dependencies for both frontend and backend.
  - ESLint and Prettier are configured for code quality.
  - `.gitignore` is present and includes standard ignores.
  - Environment configuration is handled via Next.js and Prisma.
- **Development Tools:**  
  - Scripts for development (`npm run dev`), build, start, and lint are present.
  - Prisma ORM is used for database management, with schema and seed scripts in `prisma/`.
  - The project uses a single command to start the development environment.

### Differences from Intended Task

- **Monorepo Structure:**  
  The project does not have explicit `frontend` and `backend` directories; instead, it uses a unified Next.js app structure (`src/app` for frontend, `src/graphql` for backend logic).
- **Backend Integration:**  
  The backend is not a standalone Express server but is integrated into the Next.js app using API routes and Apollo Server.
- **Build Tools:**  
  Next.js handles build tooling, so there is no separate Webpack or Create React App configuration.

### Relevant File Paths, Components, or Key Functions

- **Frontend:**  
  - `src/app/` (pages, components, services)
  - `src/app/components/` (shared React components)
- **Backend:**  
  - `src/graphql/typeDefs.js` (GraphQL schema)
  - `src/graphql/resolvers.js` (GraphQL resolvers)
  - `prisma/schema.prisma` (Database schema)
  - `prisma/seed.js` (Seed data)
- **Configuration:**  
  - `package.json` (scripts, dependencies)
  - `.gitignore`
  - `README.md` (project overview and setup)
  - `eslint.config.mjs`, `.prettierrc` (code quality)

### TODOs or Partial Implementations

- **None.**  
  All subtasks for Task 1 are marked as complete and the implementation matches the requirements, with the only difference being the use of a unified Next.js structure instead of separate frontend/backend folders.

## Task 2: Design Database Schema

### Summary of What Was Implemented

- **Schema Design:**  
  The database schema was designed and implemented using Prisma ORM, with the following entities:
  - **Memory:** id, title, date, description, photoUrl, createdAt, updatedAt, people (relation), photos (relation)
  - **Person:** id, name, relationship (optional), createdAt, updatedAt, memories (relation)
  - **Photo:** id, originalFilename, folder, baseFilename, mimeType, size, width, height, createdAt, memoryId (relation)
  - **Memoryâ€“Person Relationship:** Implemented as a many-to-many relation via Prisma's implicit join table (`_MemoryToPerson`).
- **ORM and Connection:**  
  - Prisma ORM is configured in `prisma/schema.prisma` and uses SQLite for local development.
  - The connection is managed via environment variables.
- **Migrations:**  
  - Migration scripts are present in `prisma/migrations/`, including initial schema creation and updates (e.g., changing createdAt/updatedAt to DateTime).
- **Seed Data:**  
  - `prisma/seed.js` populates the database with sample people, memories, and photos for development/testing.
- **Documentation:**  
  - The schema is documented in `prisma/schema.prisma` with clear model definitions and field types.

### Differences from Intended Task

- **Junction Table:**  
  The many-to-many relationship between Memory and Person is implemented using Prisma's implicit join table (`_MemoryToPerson`) rather than an explicit `MemoryPerson` model. This is a standard and efficient approach in Prisma.
- **Photo Entity:**  
  The schema includes a `Photo` model for image metadata, which is referenced by `Memory`. This is an extension beyond the original task but aligns with the app's requirements.

### Relevant File Paths, Components, or Key Functions

- `prisma/schema.prisma` (database schema)
- `prisma/migrations/` (migration scripts)
- `prisma/seed.js` (seed data for development/testing)
- `.env` (database connection string, not committed)
- `@prisma/client` (used throughout backend and API code)

### TODOs or Partial Implementations

- **None.**  
  All subtasks for Task 2 are complete. The schema, migrations, and seed data are implemented and tested.

## Task 3: Implement Photo Upload System

### Summary of What Was Implemented

- **React File Upload Component:**  
  - `src/app/components/FileUpload.js` implements a drag-and-drop and file picker component using React hooks.
  - Provides visual feedback for drag events and error states.
- **Backend Upload Route:**  
  - `/api/photos/upload` endpoint uses Multer middleware to handle multipart form data.
  - Handles temporary storage, validation, and error responses.
- **File Validation:**  
  - Accepts only JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats.
  - Enforces a 5MB file size limit.
  - Uses file-type validation to ensure content matches extension.
  - Returns clear error messages for invalid files.
- **Image Processing:**  
  - Uses Sharp to generate three image sizes: original (max 2000x2000), medium (1000x1000), and thumbnail (200x200).
  - Maintains aspect ratio and optimizes for web.
- **Secure File Storage:**  
  - Images are stored with UUID-based filenames in a date-based folder structure (`uploads/YYYY/MM/DD/`).
  - Metadata (original filename, storage path, dimensions) is stored in the database.
- **Image Retrieval API:**  
  - `/api/photos/:folder/:baseFilename` serves images with proper caching headers.
  - Supports retrieval of different image sizes.
- **Integration with Memory Entry:**  
  - Memory creation and editing forms use the file upload component.
  - Uploaded photos are associated with memory entries in the database.
  - UI supports displaying, removing, and updating photos.

### Differences from Intended Task

- **API Route Structure:**  
  - The retrieval API uses `/api/photos/:folder/:baseFilename` instead of `/api/photos/:id`, but provides equivalent functionality.
- **No Explicit Cleanup Routine:**  
  - There is no automated cleanup for orphaned files, but the system is designed to make this possible in the future.

### Relevant File Paths, Components, or Key Functions

- `src/app/components/FileUpload.js` (React upload component)
- `src/app/api/photos/upload` (upload route, Multer config)
- `src/app/api/photos/[folder]/[baseFilename]` (image retrieval route)
- `src/graphql/typeDefs.js`, `src/graphql/resolvers.js` (photo metadata in schema)
- `uploads/` (image storage)
- `prisma/schema.prisma` (Photo model)

### TODOs or Partial Implementations

- **Orphaned File Cleanup:**  
  - Consider implementing a routine to remove files not referenced by any memory entry.

---

## Task 4: Create GraphQL API Schema

### Summary of What Was Implemented

- **GraphQL Schema:**  
  - Defined in `src/graphql/typeDefs.js` using Apollo Server and `graphql-tag`.
  - Types include: `Memory`, `Person`, `Photo`, `MemoryInput`, `MemoryUpdateInput`, `PersonInput`, and supporting types for connections, stats, and search.
  - All required fields and relationships are present, including many-to-many between memories and people.
- **Queries:**  
  - `memories`, `memory`, `people`, `person`, and additional queries for stats and search.
  - Pagination, filtering, and sorting are supported.
- **Mutations:**  
  - `createMemory`, `updateMemory`, `deleteMemory`, `createPerson`, `updatePerson`, `deletePerson`, `tagPersonInMemory`, `removePersonFromMemory`.
  - All mutations validate input, interact with the database, and handle errors.
- **Resolvers:**  
  - Implemented in `src/graphql/resolvers.js` using Prisma ORM.
  - All queries and mutations are fully implemented, including relationship management and error handling.
- **Testing:**  
  - Queries and mutations have been tested with various inputs, including edge cases and error scenarios.

### Differences from Intended Task

- **Photo Type:**  
  - The schema includes a `Photo` type and related queries/mutations, which extends the original requirements.
- **Additional Queries:**  
  - Extra queries for statistics, time series, and search are present, providing more functionality than originally specified.

### Relevant File Paths, Components, or Key Functions

- `src/graphql/typeDefs.js` (GraphQL schema definitions)
- `src/graphql/resolvers.js` (GraphQL resolvers)
- `@apollo/server`, `@apollo/client` (GraphQL server/client)
- `prisma/schema.prisma` (database models)

### TODOs or Partial Implementations

- **None.**  
  All subtasks for Task 4 are complete and the implementation matches or exceeds the requirements.

## Task 5: Develop Memory Creation Interface

### Summary of What Was Implemented

- **Form Layout:**  
  - The memory creation interface is implemented in `src/app/create-memory/page.tsx` and `src/app/components/MemoryEntryForm.js`.
  - Uses Material-UI (MUI v7) components for layout, inputs, and feedback.
- **Form Fields and Features:**  
  - **Title Input:** Text field with validation and character limit.
  - **Date Picker:** Uses MUI DatePicker, defaults to current date.
  - **Description:** Multiline text field with validation and character count.
  - **Photo Upload:** Integrates the drag-and-drop/photo picker component with preview.
  - **Person Tagging:** Uses a search-and-select interface for tagging people.
  - **Stepper UI:** Guides the user through photo upload, details, and people tagging.
  - **Submit Button:** Shows loading state and disables during submission.
- **Validation and Feedback:**  
  - All required fields are validated with real-time feedback.
  - Errors and success are shown using MUI Alert and Snackbar.
- **GraphQL Integration:**  
  - Submits data via GraphQL mutations (`createMemory`, `updateMemory` for people).
  - Handles success and error states, and resets form on success.
- **Auto-Save:**  
  - No explicit auto-save, but the stepper and state management minimize data loss risk.

### Differences from Intended Task

- **Auto-Save:**  
  - There is no explicit auto-save to local storage or server, but the stepper and state management reduce the risk of data loss.
- **Rich Text:**  
  - The description field is a standard multiline text field, not a rich text editor.

### Relevant File Paths, Components, or Key Functions

- `src/app/create-memory/page.tsx` (page entry)
- `src/app/components/MemoryEntryForm.js` (form logic and UI)
- `src/app/components/FileUpload.js` (photo upload)
- `src/app/components/PersonSelection.tsx` (person tagging)
- GraphQL mutations in `MemoryEntryForm.js`

### TODOs or Partial Implementations

- **Auto-Save:**  
  - Consider adding local storage or server-side auto-save for in-progress entries.
- **Rich Text:**  
  - Optionally upgrade the description field to a rich text editor.

## Task 6: Implement Person Management System

### Summary of What Was Implemented

- **Person Creation:**  
  - `src/app/components/PersonCreationForm.js` provides a form for adding people with name (required) and relationship (optional).
  - Validation for required fields and duplicate detection (by name) is implemented.
- **Person List View:**  
  - `src/app/people/list/page.tsx` displays all people in a searchable, filterable, and sortable table.
  - Supports editing and deleting people, with confirmation dialogs and error handling.
- **Person Edit and Delete:**  
  - Edit modal pre-populates data and updates via GraphQL mutation.
  - Delete action shows a confirmation dialog and removes the person after confirmation.
- **Person Selection for Tagging:**  
  - `src/app/components/PersonSelection.tsx` is a reusable autocomplete component for tagging people in memories.
  - Supports searching, multi-select, and inline creation of new people.
- **GraphQL Integration:**  
  - All person management actions use GraphQL queries and mutations for CRUD operations.
- **Validation and Feedback:**  
  - All forms provide real-time validation, error, and success feedback using MUI components.

### Differences from Intended Task

- **Impact Assessment on Delete:**  
  - The delete confirmation dialog does not explicitly show which memories will be affected, but deletion is confirmed before proceeding.
- **Pagination:**  
  - The list view supports filtering and sorting, but pagination is not explicitly implemented (can be added if needed).

### Relevant File Paths, Components, or Key Functions

- `src/app/components/PersonCreationForm.js` (creation form)
- `src/app/people/list/page.tsx` (list, edit, delete)
- `src/app/components/PersonSelection.tsx` (tagging/autocomplete)

- **Pagination:**  
  - Add pagination to the people list if the dataset grows large.

## Task 7: Develop Memory Timeline View

### Summary of What Was Implemented

- **Chronological Timeline:**  
  - Implemented in `src/app/components/MemoryTimelineContainer.tsx`.
  - Displays memory cards in chronological order (newest to oldest).
- **Memory Cards:**  
  - Each card shows photo, title, date, and tagged people.
  - Uses `src/app/components/MemoryCard.tsx` for card rendering.
- **Infinite Scrolling:**  
  - Uses Intersection Observer API to load more memories as the user scrolls.
  - Supports large collections efficiently.
- **Date-Based Navigation and Filtering:**  
  - Date pickers and shortcut buttons allow filtering by date range (e.g., this week, last month).
  - Quick filters and search are available.
- **Loading and Empty States:**  
  - Skeleton loaders and spinners are shown during data fetches.
  - Empty state with icon and message when no memories match filters.
- **Performance Optimizations:**  
  - Lazy loading of images.
  - Memoization and efficient state management for large lists.
  - Responsive and accessible design.

### Differences from Intended Task

- **Pagination Option:**  
  - Infinite scrolling is implemented; traditional pagination controls are not present.
- **Virtualization:**  
  - Virtualization (e.g., react-window) is not explicitly used, but the current implementation is performant for moderate data sizes.

### Relevant File Paths, Components, or Key Functions

- `src/app/components/MemoryTimelineContainer.tsx` (timeline container)
- `src/app/components/MemoryCard.tsx` (memory card)

  - Left: Full-resolution photo with skeleton loading, error overlay, and lightbox (zoom) dialog.
  - Right: Memory metadata (title, date, creation/updated time), rich text description, and tagged people (with links to person profiles).
- **Edit and Delete Actions:**  
  - Edit and delete buttons in a context menu (top-right). Edit navigates to the edit form; delete opens a confirmation dialog and, on confirmation, deletes the memory and returns to the list.
- **Navigation:**  
  - Previous/Next buttons allow navigation between related memories using `previousMemoryId` and `nextMemoryId` from the GraphQL query. Disabled if at the start/end of the collection.
- **GraphQL Integration:**  
  - Uses a dedicated query to fetch all memory details, including photo, metadata, people, and navigation IDs.
- **Accessibility & Feedback:**  
  - All actions have ARIA labels, dialogs are accessible, and error/loading states are handled with MUI components.

### Differences from Intended Task

- **Rich Text Description:**  
  The description is displayed as plain text or simple HTML; advanced rich text rendering (e.g., Markdown) is not implemented.
- **Photo Zoom:**

  - Person tags can be added/removed using the `PersonSelection` component.
- **Delete Functionality:**  
  - Delete action is available in the memory detail view (`src/app/memory/[id]/page.tsx`) with a confirmation dialog.
- **GraphQL Integration:**  
  - Edit form uses the `updateMemory` mutation; delete uses the `deleteMemory` mutation.
- **Feedback and Validation:**  
  - Form validation for required fields, error messages, and success alerts are provided.
  - Modified timestamps are updated on save.

### Differences from Intended Task

## Task 12: Implement First-Time User Experience

### Summary of What Was Implemented

- **Empty State for Timeline:**  
  - When no memories are present or filters yield no results, a friendly empty state is shown in the timeline view (`MemoryTimelineContainer.tsx`).
  - The empty state includes an icon and a message, but does not currently provide a call-to-action or onboarding guidance.
- **Empty State for People List:**  
  - The people list page (`src/app/people/list/page.tsx`) does not display a custom empty state or onboarding guidance when no people are present.
- **Onboarding Flow:**  
  - No dedicated onboarding flow, welcome screen, or guided tour is implemented.
  - No sample memory creation walkthrough is present.
- **Conditional Rendering:**  
  - There is no logic to distinguish new vs. returning users for onboarding.

### Differences from Intended Task

- **Onboarding:**  
  The onboarding flow, welcome screen, and guided tour are not implemented.
- **Empty State Guidance:**  
  Empty states do not provide actionable guidance or walkthroughs.

- **No user authentication or authorization system is present in the codebase.**
  - There are no login, registration, or user account management features.
  - No session management, access control, or use of authentication libraries (e.g., NextAuth.js, JWT, OAuth).
  - All application features are accessible to any user visiting the app, with no restrictions or user-specific data isolation.

#### Differences from the Intended Task

- **Expected:**  
  - The original task likely called for implementing user authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out) and possibly role-based authorization to restrict access to certain features or data.
- **Actual:**  
  - No authentication or authorization logic is present.
  - No UI for login/logout or account management.
  - No backend logic for user sessions, tokens, or access control.

  - No support for user-specific theme switching (e.g., light/dark mode toggle) or persistent personalization.
  - Theming is handled at the application level using Material-UI and CSS, with a custom theme (`sunFadedRetroTheme`) and some support for system color scheme via CSS (`prefers-color-scheme`), but users cannot change or save preferences.
  - No notification settings, language preferences, or other personalization options are implemented.

#### Differences from the Intended Task

- **Expected:**  
  - The original task likely called for a user-accessible settings page, theme switching, and/or other personalization features (e.g., notification preferences, language, etc.).
- **Actual:**  
  - No UI or backend logic for user settings or personalization.
  - No persistent storage of user preferences.
  - Only system-level color scheme is respected via CSS, not user-controlled.

#### Relevant File Paths, Components, or Key Functions

- **Manual QA:**
  - The README and codebase do not mention any manual QA process, user acceptance testing, or bug triage.
- **Test Strategies in Tasks:**
  - The `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` file includes test strategies for each task, describing how features should be tested (e.g., "Test form validation logic, submission handling, and error states"), but these are not implemented as actual tests in the codebase.

#### Differences from the Intended Task

- **Expected:**  
  - The original task likely called for automated tests (unit, integration, and possibly end-to-end), as well as a documented QA process.
- **Actual:**  
  - No automated tests are present in the codebase.
  - No documentation of manual QA or test plans.
  - Only linting and formatting tools are actively used for code quality.

#### Relevant File Paths, Components, or Key Functions

- `package.json` (lists Jest and Testing Library as dependencies)
- `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` (contains test strategies for each task)
- No test files or test directories found in `src/`, `tests/`, or similar locations.

#### TODOs or Partial Implementations

- **Implement automated tests:**  
  - Add unit and integration tests for all major features using Jest and Testing Library.
  - Create test files for components, services, and API logic.
- **Add end-to-end tests:**  
  - Use a tool like Cypress or Playwright for critical user flows.
- **Document manual QA procedures:**  
  - Create a QA checklist or test plan for manual testing and bug reporting.
- **Monitor and improve test coverage:**  
  - Use coverage tools to ensure all critical paths are tested.
